# DML_COX.py: 
'DML_CoxPH' fit the double robust Cox Linear regression model, output the linear parameter in the Cox model of interst, their estimated variance, and the estimated nuisance function, including the culmulated hazard function.

# colon.csv \& colon_death.ipynb: 
Levamisole is a low-toxicity compound previously used to treat worm infestations in animals; 5-FU is a moderately toxic (as these things go) chemotherapy agent. There are two time records per person, one for recurrence of the cancer and the other for death. In this example, we analyze the effectiveness of the chemotherapy for Stage B/C colon cancer.

# rotterdam.csv \& rotterdam.ipynb: 
The data ***rotterdam*** study the potential factors that affect the survival time of cancer patients, defined as the days from the primary surgery to disease recurrence or death, whichever came earlier. The data consist of 2982 subjects with 57.35\% censoring rate and nine baseline covariates (i.e., age, progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, number of positive lymph nodes, menopausal status, tumor size, tumor grade, chemotherapy and hormonal treatment), among which the first four variables are continuous and the last five are discrete. The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of the chemotherapy and hormonal treatments.
